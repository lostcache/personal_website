    description="Software engineer and computer science graduate student exploring distributed systems, full-stack development, and systems programming"

    <h2>Hey there! I'm Harsh.</h2>

    <p>
        I'm a computer science graduate student at Loyola Marymount University,
        currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at <a
            href="https://research.kubishi.com/">Kubishi</a
        >, where I'm diving deep into pursuit-evasion optimization problems
        using Python and Mathematica. When I'm not analyzing competitive ratios
        for pursuit strategies, you'll find me building systems that need to be
        fast, reliable, and scalable.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

    <p>
        My passion lies in distributed systems and systems programming. I
        recently built <a href="https://github.com/lostcache/zue">Zue</a>, a
        distributed storage engine in Zig that implements Raft-like consensus
        with quorum-based replication. There's something deeply satisfying about
        building systems that can handle failures gracefully and maintain
        consistency across multiple nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the full-stack side, I've worked with modern web technologies like
        React, Next.js, Node.js, and FastAPI. At SetFindr, I built a P2P
        marketplace implementing OAuth2.0 authentication, vector search with
        Qdrant, and NLP features using OpenAI's API. I'm comfortable across the
        entire stack, from optimizing database queries to building responsive
        frontends.
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

    <p>
        This blog is where I share what I'm learning and building. Expect posts
        about distributed systems, systems programming, web development, and the
        occasional deep dive into optimization problems. I write about the
        challenges I encounter, the solutions I discover, and the lessons
        learned along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether it's implementing consensus algorithms, optimizing API
        performance, or exploring new programming languages like Zig and Rust, I
        believe in learning by building. And then writing about it so others
        (and future me) can benefit from the experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Before grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer at Nexuslink
        Services in India, where I built React-Redux SPAs, implemented
        authentication systems, and created automated document generation
        pipelines. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
        from Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University.
    </p>

    <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

    <p>
        I'm always interested in discussing technology, collaborating on
        projects, or just chatting about interesting problems. You can find me
        on <a href="https://github.com/lostcache">GitHub</a> where I share my projects,
        or connect with me on <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-devisha/">LinkedIn</a
        >. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:harshdevisha91@gmail.com"
